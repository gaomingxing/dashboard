/**
 * Middleware native rewrite config
 *
 * We implement rewrites directly in middleware rather than using Next.js's built-in
 * `rewrites` configuration in next.config.js because we need to set custom request
 * and response headers for these rewritten requests.
 *
 * Specifically, we need to:
 * - Add custom headers to the request (e.g., x-e2b-should-index for SEO control)
 * - Set custom response headers (e.g., X-Robots-Tag for search engine indexing)
 * - Have fine-grained control over the rewrite behavior based on environment variables
 *
 * Next.js's native rewrite configuration doesn't provide this level of header manipulation
 * capability, so we handle these rewrites in our middleware layer where we have full
 * control over the request/response cycle.
